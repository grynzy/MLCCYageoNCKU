Challenge in #sintering simulations:
Taking into account all the coupled physics present in the sintering process.

The model should predict:
1. Convection
2. Surface to surface radiation
3. Conduction
4. Specimen sintering phenomena
5. Proportional integral derivative regulation

 ### Research novelties
 The fluid dynamics thermo-mechanical model 
 - Predict the degree of uniformity of heating and compaction of a large size gear shape specimens under various process conditions

*Source of heat*
--
1. combustion
2. high temperature resistive heating elements

Heat is then transmitted to the sample by thermal radiation, conduction and convection
