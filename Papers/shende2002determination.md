# Research Objective
## Independent variables
Thermogravimetric as a function of heating rate

## Dependent variables
Decomposition kinetics of poly(vinyl butyral) binder form barium titanate MLCC with platinum metal electrodes

# Important findings
- Thermal decompisition of polymers is often use to convertt solid-phase binder into gas-phase decomposition products
