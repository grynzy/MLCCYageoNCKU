Basically, MLLC is a sintered ceramic devise; the layered structure was formed by sintering of Ni internal electrodes and ceramic dielectrics

High temperature heat process is really required #indispensable 

Effective rapid binder burn-out method of MLCC is on attention

Binder burn-out test between #Yageo and #Noritake is ongoing

## How to work on their [[unique gas flow system]] and [[superheated steam binder burn-out mechanism]] like [[simulation of gas (steam) flow]] and [[theory]] construction is *required*

# Questions
1. [[Production of MLCC]]
2. [[Disadvantage of the current production]]
3. [[Finite element analysis]]

==Highlight==
=
1. In the burn out process, the carbon emission wants to be reduced
2. But with the superheated steam process that successfully produce less carbon emission, will it affect the important properties of the MLCC material?
3. How can the superheated steam affect the carbon emission?
4. How can such the burn out technique **instead** increase the desired properties of MLCC?

# Task
See [[000Papers from Prof Chou]] 

When I tried to find papers that do research related multilayer ceramic capacitors with poroelasticity to be concerned, only [[singh2006plane]] appeared
