# Problem statement
The low dielectric breakdown strength and high loss at high temperatures are still key challenges

During the sintering process, a low-melting interfacial liquid alloy layer is formed when the metal electrodes are under tension.

This interfacial liquid phase accelerates stress-induced diffusion
$\ggg$ the key cause for the formation of severe electrode discontinuities and pores between the internal electrodes and dielectric layer during heating
