# Research Objectives
Developed model to describe flow in porous media from the thermal decomposition of binder in 3d bodies with anisotropic permeability

## Dependent variables
Pressure within the body

## Independent variables
Position
Time
Temperature

# Important findings
Binder burnout involves a number of coupled #kinetic and transport phenomena
#kinetic phenomena is difficult to be described because the rate of binder decomposition depends on:
1. Atmosphere
2. Catalytic effects between the solid phases and the organic phases
3. Blends of organic phases are often used to aid in the processing of the green components
	1. Each phase has different decomposition behavior

## Then, how to determine the kinematics?
1. Record the weight loss of binder from thermogravimetric experiments
2. Use kinetic models to extract the preexponential factor and activation energy of the decomposition process

The mass transport phenomena thac occur during binder removal:
1. Diffusion and capillary migration of low-viscosity components
	- control during the initial stages of binder removal for green components highly loaded with organic phases
2. Pressure-driven gas-phase flow of the binder decomposition products
	- more rapid transport process for bodies containing open #porosity

# Important findings
Treats the heat transfer and pressure-driven flow of binder decomposition products for bodies of 3-D

The model can also treat #anisotropic #permeability within the body because:

"In MLCC the flow is preferential parallel to the metal layers"

They have derived analytical solution by:
1. Invoked the pseudo-steady-state partial differential equation into 3D Poisson's equation
	- The solution to which is an infinites series that converges rapidly

The analytical solution is satisfactory for describing the pressure field within the green body 

Successfully develop a criterion to assess under what conditions the analytical solution will be accurate
