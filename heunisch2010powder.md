# Independent Variables
1. Different shape of particle
	1. platelets
	2. spherical
	3. standard
2. Different types of polyvinylbutyral binders
3. Different casting velocity
4. Different blade gap height

# Dependent Variables
1. Shrinkage

# Important Findings
The molecular weight of the binders does affect the viscosity of the slurry and the shear stresses acting during tape casting

But the applied forces on a particle in a shear gradient and the resulting particle rotation and alignment are independent of the slurry viscosity

The molecules relax after the stretch (caused by alignment of the binder molecules in casting direction), byt they leave behind anisotropic pores after binder #burnout 
	- influence the shrinkage behavior
	- The effect is only visible for very high chain lengths like in the binder B-74
