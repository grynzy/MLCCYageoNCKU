# Research Objective
Study the electro-thermal processes in multilayer ceramic capacitors

The study also used digital twin that allows to analyze capacitor's operating under different electrical and thermal regimes
# Software
COMSOL Multiphysics

# What to be investigated
- Electrical stress
- Current density
- Temperature

# Question
1. This paper talked about the thermal process happened during the operation of the capacitor, not in the production process of itself. Therefore, is it still relevant to utilize this paper?
