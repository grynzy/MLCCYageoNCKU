# 2. MLCC configuration and production
![[Pasted image 20210411143624.png]]
Most MLCC are produced by a co-firing process where the internal electrodes and the ceramic materials are heated simultaneously
## Production Process
1. Powder milling
2. Foil casting
3. Inner electrode printing
4. Stacking
5. Lamination
6. Cutting
7. Binder burn out
8. Sintering
9. Tumbling
10. Termination dipping
11. Termination plating
12. 100% testing/inspection
13. Taping


# 3. Oxygen vacancies: migrations and effects
*Related to [[Binder burn out]]*
Kiln temperature:
- Remove oxygen from the base metal electrodes 
- Remove the oxygen from $\ce{BaTiO3}$ dielectric

It leaves oxygen vacancies behind
Effects:
1. Disrupt the dielectric properties of the ceramic
2. Induce a PN junction behavior
	1. create asymmetrical insulation resistance

# Question
1. Should we use the theory of oxygen vacancies occured after the sintering process? Because I think it's in the different concern with what we are doing. We are investigating the effect of burnout process
2.
