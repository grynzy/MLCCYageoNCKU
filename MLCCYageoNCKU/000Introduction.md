Basically, MLLC is a sintered ceramic devise; the layered structure was formed by sintering of Ni internal electrodes and ceramic dielectrics

High temperature heat process is really required #indispensable 

Effective rapid binder burn-out method of MLCC is on attention

Binder burn-out test between #Yageo and #Noritake is ongoing

## How to work on their [[unique gas flow system]] and [[superheated steam binder burn-out mechanism]] like [[simulation of gas (steam) flow]] and [[theory]] construction is *required*

# Questions
1. [[Production of MLCC]]
2. [[Disadvantage of the current production]]
3. [[Finite element analysis]]
