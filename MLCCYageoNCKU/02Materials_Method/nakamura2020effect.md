## Rapid debinding of alumina molded bodies
# Method
Superheated steam at:
- 1 kg/h to 5 kg/h
- temperature increase of 10 Celcius/min to a holding range of 600 to 800 Celcius

# Results
Carbon removal rate increase in the case of debinding treatment iwth superheated steam amount of 3 kg/h to 5 kg/h
	- removal rate of 98.8% after treated with  superheated steam at 800 C with 5 kg/h
No cracking occurred in alumina molded bodies obtained by debinding in superheated steam

# Question
1. This data just concerned on the alumina molded bodies, not as a whole structure of MLCC which also consists of dielectric ceramics
2.
