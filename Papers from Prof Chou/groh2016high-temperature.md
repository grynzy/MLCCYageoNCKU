# Research objectives
$\ce{BaTiO3}$ disadvantage:
- low #Curie_Temperature ($T_c$) of about $130^oC$

Higher Curie temperature MLCC? Yes they have!
Kemet High-temperature C0G series) up to $200^oC$
**But their permittivity is relatively small**

# Question
1. Should we consider in investigating the alternative materials?
2. This paper hasn't done the finite element analysis, should we perform that for the comparison with the sample that will be given to us by Yageon?
