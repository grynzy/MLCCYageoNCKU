7. [[scott1990thermal]]
Concerned on the thermal stress that might induce crack after MLCC is treated by wave soldering
Important: Thermal stress cracking of MLCC is caused by the inability of the MLCC to absorb stress, resulting from excessive temperature gradients
	- Caused by mismatch of the mechanical and thermal properties of the constituent materials of the MLCC and the rate of change of temperature across the MLCC during movement through the solder wave
8. [[song2017compositionally]]
Reported successful synthesizing of CGML ceramic based on modified BaTiO3 based dielectric compositions.

The dielectric response of CGML capacitor was simulated using phase field simulation

Metal ions substitution will result in the formation of oxygen vacancy.
- Hinders the grain growth process, resulting in fine grain of ceramics.
- Small sized grains are advantageous for reducing the thickness of dielectric layers
- Smaller grain size also provide a higher dielectric strength because grain boundaries act as barriers for the oxygen vacancies

Phase Field simulation was done to investigate the effects of grain microstructures and composition distirbutions on the temperature-dependent dielectric properties

Things to be concerned in phase field simulation:
1. Parallel configuration
2. Effect of layer thickness
3. Effect of connectivity of composition distributions
