# Research Objective
Describing a three-dimensional finite element model describing the thermal-mechanical stress distribution in multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs) during:
- termination firing
- soldering
- bending test

# Introduction
### MLCC
= layered composite structures consisting of alternating layers of metal inner electrodes and dielectric ceramics sandwiched between two ceramic  cover layers

Paragraph 1:
Explanation of MLCC and drawbacks:
During manufacturing and operation especially in automobile, however, the components of MLCCs are stressed by mechanical, thermal, and electrical loads.

### Need statement
Thermal shock test, board flex (bending) test, and biased humidity test are required to ensure the drawbacks of mechanical, thermal, and electrical loads applied
